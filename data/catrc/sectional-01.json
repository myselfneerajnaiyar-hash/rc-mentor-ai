      "text": "Modern philosophical discussions of rationality often assume that reasoning is an internal, self-contained cognitive process governed primarily by formal rules of logic. This assumption, however, obscures the extent to which reasoning is shaped by social practices, linguistic conventions, and historically contingent norms. Far from being a purely abstract activity, rational thought emerges from shared frameworks that determine what counts as a valid question, a persuasive argument, or an acceptable conclusion.\n\nPhilosophers who emphasize formal logic tend to regard deviations from strict deductive reasoning as errors or cognitive biases. Yet such deviations may reflect adaptive responses to complex environments where information is incomplete, ambiguous, or contested. In these contexts, reliance on heuristics, analogies, and narrative coherence can be more practically effective than strict adherence to logical form.\n\nMoreover, the criteria by which arguments are evaluated are rarely neutral. What one intellectual tradition considers rigorous may appear overly narrow or irrelevant to another. Scientific reasoning, legal reasoning, and moral reasoning each employ distinct standards of justification, even when addressing similar questions. Attempts to impose a single, unified model of rationality risk ignoring these domain-specific requirements.\n\nThe social dimension of reasoning becomes particularly evident in public deliberation. Arguments gain traction not solely because they are logically valid, but because they resonate with shared values, institutional norms, and cultural narratives. Persuasion, therefore, cannot be reduced to logical demonstration alone.\n\nRecognizing the contextual nature of rationality does not entail abandoning standards of reasoning altogether. Instead, it calls for a more pluralistic understanding of rational thought—one that acknowledges the legitimacy of multiple forms of justification while remaining attentive to their limitations.",

          "explanation": "The passage consistently challenges the idea that rationality is purely an internal, formal process governed only by logic. The author argues that reasoning is shaped by social practices, linguistic norms, and contextual demands. Option A correctly captures this central claim. Option B is incorrect because the author does not argue for replacing logic entirely, only for recognizing its limits. Option C exaggerates the critique; the author does not dismiss philosophical theories wholesale. Option D misrepresents the argument by suggesting logic is secondary to consensus, whereas the author advocates pluralism rather than substitution."

      "text": "Economic theory has long relied on simplified assumptions about human behavior, such as rational self-interest and stable preferences. These assumptions enable economists to construct models that are analytically elegant and mathematically tractable. However, the very simplicity that allows such models to function also limits their ability to explain observed economic behavior.\n\nEmpirical research has repeatedly demonstrated that individuals frequently deviate from rational choice predictions. Decisions are influenced by framing effects, social norms, and perceptions of fairness, often at the expense of material self-interest. These findings have fueled the rise of behavioral economics, which seeks to integrate psychological insights into economic analysis.\n\nCritics argue that incorporating behavioral complexity threatens the coherence of economic theory. If preferences are unstable and context-dependent, models may lose their predictive power and generalizability. This concern reflects a broader tension between realism and abstraction within the discipline.\n\nYet abstraction itself is not neutral. Choices about which variables to include or exclude shape the conclusions models produce. By neglecting factors such as power relations or institutional constraints, models may implicitly legitimize existing economic arrangements rather than subject them to scrutiny.\n\nA more reflexive approach to economic modeling would recognize abstraction as a tool rather than a mirror of reality. Instead of seeking a single, unified model of economic behavior, economists might employ multiple models, each suited to particular questions and contexts.",

      "text": "Sociological analyses of institutions often emphasize formal rules and organizational structures as the primary determinants of social behavior. While such frameworks explain patterns of authority and coordination, they frequently overlook the informal practices through which institutions function in everyday life. Rules do not operate automatically; they are interpreted, negotiated, and sometimes resisted by the individuals subject to them.\n\nStudies of bureaucratic organizations reveal that informal norms often shape outcomes more decisively than official regulations. Employees develop shared understandings regarding which rules can be bent, which can be ignored, and which must be strictly enforced. These practices enable organizations to manage complexity and uncertainty.\n\nHowever, informal practices also generate unintended consequences. They can reproduce inequalities by privileging insiders familiar with institutional culture while marginalizing outsiders. Additionally, because informal norms operate outside formal accountability mechanisms, responsibility for failures becomes difficult to assign.\n\nThis tension between formal structure and informal practice complicates conventional views of institutional rationality. Institutions may appear coherent on paper while functioning through flexible arrangements in practice. Understanding institutions therefore requires attention to both codified rules and lived experience.\n\nA sociological perspective that foregrounds informal practices does not deny the importance of formal rules. Instead, it highlights the dynamic interaction between structure and agency through which institutions persist and adapt.",

      "text": "Contemporary cognitive science increasingly challenges the assumption that cognition is confined to processes occurring solely within the brain. Theories of extended cognition propose that cognitive activity often involves interactions between neural processes, bodily actions, and external artifacts such as tools and technologies.\n\nProponents argue that when external resources reliably perform functions equivalent to internal mental processes, they should be considered part of cognition itself. A notebook used consistently for memory storage, for instance, may function analogously to biological memory, blurring the boundary between mind and environment.\n\nCritics contend that such an expansive view risks conceptual overreach. If every external aid counts as cognitive, the concept of cognition may lose explanatory precision. They argue that external tools lack intrinsic intentionality and biological integration.\n\nThe debate centers not on whether tools influence thinking but on how to demarcate cognitive systems. Some theorists propose criteria such as reliability, automaticity, and integration to distinguish genuine cognitive extensions from mere aids.\n\nResolving this debate has implications beyond philosophy of mind. Definitions of cognition shape research in education, human–computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. A nuanced account must balance inclusiveness with conceptual rigor.",
