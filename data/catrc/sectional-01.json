      "text": "Modern philosophical discussions of rationality often assume that reasoning is an internal, self-contained cognitive process governed primarily by formal rules of logic. This assumption, however, obscures the extent to which reasoning is shaped by social practices, linguistic conventions, and historically contingent norms. Far from being a purely abstract activity, rational thought emerges from shared frameworks that determine what counts as a valid question, a persuasive argument, or an acceptable conclusion.\n\nPhilosophers who emphasize formal logic tend to regard deviations from strict deductive reasoning as errors or cognitive biases. Yet such deviations may reflect adaptive responses to complex environments where information is incomplete, ambiguous, or contested. In these contexts, reliance on heuristics, analogies, and narrative coherence can be more practically effective than strict adherence to logical form.\n\nMoreover, the criteria by which arguments are evaluated are rarely neutral. What one intellectual tradition considers rigorous may appear overly narrow or irrelevant to another. Scientific reasoning, legal reasoning, and moral reasoning each employ distinct standards of justification, even when addressing similar questions. Attempts to impose a single, unified model of rationality risk ignoring these domain-specific requirements.\n\nThe social dimension of reasoning becomes particularly evident in public deliberation. Arguments gain traction not solely because they are logically valid, but because they resonate with shared values, institutional norms, and cultural narratives. Persuasion, therefore, cannot be reduced to logical demonstration alone.\n\nRecognizing the contextual nature of rationality does not entail abandoning standards of reasoning altogether. Instead, it calls for a more pluralistic understanding of rational thought—one that acknowledges the legitimacy of multiple forms of justification while remaining attentive to their limitations.",

          "explanation": "The author consistently challenges the assumption that reasoning is a purely internal, formal process governed only by logic. Instead, the passage emphasizes that reasoning is shaped by social, linguistic, and contextual factors. Option A captures this central thrust by noting the insufficiency of formal logic alone in explaining real-world reasoning. Option B is incorrect because the author does not advocate replacing logic entirely, only supplementing it. Option C exaggerates the critique; the author does not dismiss philosophical theories wholesale. Option D misrepresents the argument by suggesting that social agreement supersedes logic, whereas the passage stresses pluralism rather than replacement."

      "text": "Economic models often rely on simplified assumptions about human behavior, such as rational self-interest and stable preferences. These assumptions allow economists to construct elegant models capable of generating precise predictions. However, the very features that make these models tractable also limit their explanatory power when applied to real-world economic behavior.\n\nEmpirical studies repeatedly demonstrate that individuals do not always act in accordance with rational choice theory. Preferences shift over time, decisions are influenced by framing effects, and individuals frequently prioritize fairness or social norms over material gain. Such findings have prompted the emergence of behavioral economics, which seeks to incorporate psychological insights into economic analysis.\n\nCritics of behavioral economics argue that abandoning simplifying assumptions risks sacrificing analytical clarity. Without stable preferences or rational actors, models may become too context-dependent to yield generalizable insights. This concern reflects a broader tension between realism and abstraction in economic theory.\n\nYet abstraction itself is not value-neutral. The choice of which factors to simplify and which to emphasize shapes the conclusions a model produces. Models that ignore inequality, power relations, or institutional constraints may inadvertently legitimize existing economic arrangements rather than critically examining them.\n\nA more reflexive approach to economic modeling would acknowledge both the usefulness and the limitations of abstraction. Rather than seeking a single, comprehensive model of economic behavior, economists might employ a plurality of models, each suited to specific questions and contexts.",

      "text": "Sociological accounts of modern institutions often assume that formal rules and organizational structures are the primary determinants of social behavior. While such frameworks help explain patterns of authority and coordination, they frequently overlook the informal practices through which institutions are enacted in everyday life. Rules do not operate in isolation; they are interpreted, negotiated, and sometimes resisted by the individuals subject to them.\n\nResearch on bureaucratic organizations reveals that informal norms frequently shape outcomes more decisively than official regulations. Employees develop shared understandings about which rules are flexible, which can be ignored, and which must be strictly enforced. These informal practices are not merely deviations from institutional design; they are functional adaptations that enable organizations to cope with complexity, uncertainty, and resource constraints.\n\nHowever, the reliance on informal norms also produces unintended consequences. Practices developed to increase efficiency can reproduce inequalities by privileging insiders who possess tacit knowledge while marginalizing those unfamiliar with institutional culture. Moreover, informal arrangements often evade accountability mechanisms, making it difficult to identify responsibility when failures occur.\n\nThe tension between formal structure and informal practice challenges simplistic notions of institutional rationality. Institutions may appear coherent and rule-bound on paper while operating through flexible, context-sensitive arrangements in practice. Understanding institutions, therefore, requires attention not only to their formal design but also to the social processes that sustain them.\n\nA sociological analysis that foregrounds informal practices does not deny the importance of formal rules. Instead, it highlights the dynamic interaction between codified structures and lived experience. Institutions persist not because rules are perfectly enforced, but because actors continually adapt those rules to the demands of concrete situations.",

      "text": "Contemporary cognitive science increasingly challenges the view that cognition is confined to processes occurring solely within the brain. According to extended cognition theories, cognitive activity often involves interactions between neural processes, bodily actions, and external artifacts. Tools such as notebooks, diagrams, and digital devices do not merely aid cognition; they can become integral components of cognitive systems.\n\nProponents of extended cognition argue that when external resources reliably perform functions equivalent to internal mental processes, they should be considered part of cognition itself. For example, a notebook used consistently to store and retrieve information may function analogously to biological memory. This perspective dissolves the sharp boundary traditionally drawn between mind and environment.\n\nCritics contend that such an expansive definition of cognition risks conceptual overreach. If every external aid is counted as cognitive, the concept of cognition may lose explanatory precision. They argue that external tools differ fundamentally from neural processes because they lack intrinsic intentionality and biological integration.\n\nThe debate hinges not on whether tools influence thinking—a point few dispute—but on how to demarcate cognitive systems. Some theorists propose criteria such as reliability, automaticity, and integration to distinguish genuinely cognitive extensions from mere aids. These criteria aim to preserve explanatory rigor while acknowledging the role of environmental scaffolding.\n\nThe implications of this debate extend beyond philosophy of mind. How cognition is defined affects research in education, human–computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. A nuanced account of extended cognition must balance inclusiveness with conceptual discipline, recognizing that cognition may be distributed without becoming unbounded.",
