      "difficulty": "medium-hard",
      "text": "Urban development debates often frame density as either a solution to environmental degradation or as a cause of declining quality of life. Proponents of high-density development argue that compact cities reduce per-capita energy consumption by shortening travel distances, enabling efficient public transportation, and preserving surrounding ecosystems. Critics counter that density exacerbates congestion, strains infrastructure, and erodes social cohesion.\n\nThese opposing views frequently rest on selective evidence. While dense urban cores can reduce automobile dependence, they also require careful planning to avoid overcrowding and service bottlenecks. Density alone does not guarantee sustainability; governance capacity, land-use regulation, and investment in public goods play decisive roles.\n\nHistorical examples illustrate this complexity. Cities that pursued density without parallel investment in sanitation, housing quality, and public transit often experienced deteriorating living conditions. Conversely, cities that combined density with inclusive planning mechanisms—such as mixed-use zoning and affordable housing mandates—managed to balance efficiency with livability.\n\nThe distributional effects of density further complicate the debate. Rising land values in dense areas can displace lower-income residents, transforming sustainability initiatives into drivers of inequality. Without safeguards, density-oriented policies risk prioritizing environmental metrics while neglecting social equity.\n\nA more productive approach reframes density as a conditional tool rather than an intrinsic virtue. Urban outcomes depend less on how many people occupy a space than on how institutions manage growth, allocate resources, and respond to resident needs. Recognizing this shifts attention from abstract density targets to the concrete political and administrative choices that shape urban life.",

Option A accurately captures this conditional framing. Option B is incorrect because the passage explicitly rejects density as an automatic solution. Option C exaggerates one consequence discussed but ignores the broader argument. Option D contradicts the author’s call for a nuanced, rather than oppositional, view of density."

      "genre": "Game Theory",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "text": "Game theory models strategic interaction by assuming rational agents who seek to maximize their payoffs given the expected actions of others. These models have generated insights across economics, political science, and evolutionary biology. However, their reliance on common knowledge and stable preferences raises questions about applicability in real-world settings.\n\nIn practice, individuals often operate under uncertainty regarding others’ intentions, available strategies, or even the structure of the game itself. Experimental studies demonstrate that players frequently rely on heuristics, social norms, or fairness considerations rather than strict equilibrium reasoning. Such behavior may appear irrational within formal models but can be adaptive in environments characterized by incomplete information.\n\nAttempts to address these limitations have produced refinements such as bounded rationality and behavioral game theory. These approaches relax assumptions about perfect optimization while preserving strategic interaction as a core concept. Yet they also complicate prediction, as outcomes become sensitive to psychological parameters that vary across contexts.\n\nCritics argue that expanding game theory to incorporate behavioral factors risks diluting its explanatory power. If models can be adjusted to fit almost any observed behavior, their capacity to generate falsifiable predictions diminishes. Supporters counter that realism enhances relevance, even at the cost of elegance.\n\nThe tension between tractability and realism reflects a broader methodological dilemma. Rather than seeking a single definitive model, some scholars advocate using multiple game-theoretic frameworks, each tailored to specific empirical domains. This pluralistic stance treats models as instruments for understanding, not as literal descriptions of human behavior.",

      "genre": "Linguistics",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "text": "Linguistic theories have long debated whether meaning is primarily a property of sentences or of their use in context. Formal semantic approaches attempt to specify meaning through abstract rules that map linguistic expressions to truth conditions. While this enables precision, it often struggles to account for pragmatic phenomena such as implicature, irony, and contextual enrichment.\n\nPragmatic theories emphasize that speakers routinely convey meanings that exceed literal sentence content. Listeners draw on shared knowledge, conversational norms, and assumptions about speaker intentions to infer what is meant rather than what is strictly said. This inferential process allows communication to remain efficient despite underspecification.\n\nHowever, privileging pragmatics raises its own difficulties. If meaning depends too heavily on context, linguistic analysis risks becoming indeterminate, as almost any interpretation could be justified post hoc. Critics argue that without constraints, pragmatic accounts lack explanatory rigor.\n\nRecent approaches seek to reconcile semantics and pragmatics by viewing them as complementary rather than competing. Under such models, semantic structure provides a stable baseline that pragmatics enriches through systematic, rule-governed processes. Meaning emerges from the interaction of encoded content and contextual inference.\n\nThis integrative perspective reshapes longstanding disputes. Instead of asking whether meaning resides in sentences or contexts, it reframes the question as how linguistic systems coordinate formal structure with flexible use. Such coordination underlies the productivity and adaptability of human language.",

Such narratives suggest that once a technology emerges, its social consequences are inevitable. This view obscures the role of human agency in shaping technological trajectories.\n\nHistorical analyses reveal that technologies are embedded in social, economic, and political contexts that influence how they are adopted and used. Competing interests, regulatory choices, and cultural values all affect whether a technology amplifies inequality, enhances productivity, or alters power relations.\n\nThe determinist framing also simplifies ethical debates. If technological outcomes are inevitable, moral responsibility appears diffused, reducing incentives for deliberate intervention. By contrast, recognizing contingency highlights opportunities for governance and design choices that align technological development with societal goals.\n\nYet rejecting determinism does not imply unlimited control. Technologies impose constraints by enabling certain actions while foreclosing others. The challenge lies in navigating this constrained flexibility, balancing innovation with accountability.\n\nUnderstanding technology as a socio-technical process reframes policy discussions. It shifts attention from predicting technological futures to shaping them through institutions, norms, and collective decision-making.",
